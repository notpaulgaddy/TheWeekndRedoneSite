<h1><strong>The Weeknd Capstone</strong></h1>

<br>
<h2><strong>Project Introduction</strong></h2>
<h2>Hi, this is my capstone project in order to better learn ReactJS as well as improve my UI/UX design skills. I will walk you through this process</h2>
<h3>After completing my previous React project which lets you sign into Spotify and add songs to your playlist, I decided that I wanted to do something with absolutely no direction in order to push myself. We all know that building projects on things you're interested in helps you learn better, so who better to do it on than Abel Tesfaye? Especially since I have 54 songs that he's on in my Spotify liked songs!</h3>

<h2>Before you do any web design, you must ask yourself 3 essential things</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Who is this for?</li>
  <li>What are their needs?</li>
  <li>What value do we bring them?</li>
</ol>
